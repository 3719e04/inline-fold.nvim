# inline-fold.nvim

`inline-fold.nvim` is a Neovim plugin inspired by the vscode plugin `inline-fold`. It provides a convenient way to make complex CSS classes, especially those with Tailwind CSS, more readable by folding the class content and displaying a placeholder.

**Note: The plugin now uses conceal and needs to be reapplied on every change to the class field. It also doesn't work for multiline classes.**
